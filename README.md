# Landing Page
This little project is a demostration of my abilities
I have developed in the HTML and CSS fields.

It is an exercise where I have to make the structure of a 
landing page. I've been given an image of how it should look
and another image on the different graphic elements that
are used to build this page.

The objective is for me to put in practice many thing. From setting up
the project on GitHub, to build the HTML structure and give the proper
design on CSS.

I'll do this by putting in use the many lessons from the course but
manily by looking at some solutions by "googling" them. This last
one is also part of the whole process so I can develop my research 
and problem solving skills.
